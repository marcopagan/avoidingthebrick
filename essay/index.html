              It was 2011 when I got my first smartphone. A Samsung Galaxy S:
              the first model of a successful series of smartphones, still among
              the most popular today. I remember the fascination that a
              14-year-old guy who was passionate about technology could have in
              front of that object. It felt like a miniature computer with
              unlimited potential. In less than a year I was hooked on the
              Android world, trying to figure out how to make the most of such a
              tool. After some months since I bought the phone, Google released
              a new version of Android: 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. Needless to say,
              I couldn't wait to get the update from the company so I could try
              all the new features and graphical innovations. I soon discovered
              that my phone was a variant of the more famous flagship model,
              called Samsung Galaxy S SCL. This device differed by a few
              components from its main model, such as type of screen, GPU, and
              memory. However, this was enough to make it not compatible with
              the updates that the flagship model received. Digging into Android
              tech-enthusiast forums I discovered that some independent
              developers created unofficial updates of Android for my phone:
              that was my first contact with modding communities. From that time
              I started to mod my device by downloading and installing (or
              <a

                onclick="openToastGlossaryClick('glossary_flashing', 'c0')"
                >flashing</a
              >
              to use a tech slang term) unofficial firmwares, skins and mods,
              together with a friend of mine with the same phone model as me.
              The period between 2010 and 2018 was really prolific for
              developers and users: the influence this community has on the
              smartphone market it’s tangible.

              Parallel to that path, as an enthusiast, I felt the need to
              communicate the existence of this underworld, mostly the
              prerogative of Android nerds. I wanted to enter this community as
              an active member. So, after some experiments made the year before,
              in July 2013 my friend Davide and I opened a YouTube channel
              dedicated to Android modding. The goal was to raise awareness of
              the culture of modding in Italy, where at the time it was still
              not widespread. From 2012 to 2016 we made informative videos about
              the smartphone market, next to reviews and tutorials about
              modding. We got in touch with different developers, met and
              supported small independent projects that were trying to come up
              with an open and user-oriented idea of technology. One aspect that
              I became aware of only later is the political power of this
              community: modding is not just about solving technical issues but
              is a collective effort to elaborate an idea of technology that
              they intend to apply to society. Users and enthusiasts come
              together spontaneously to react to market trends that they see as
              not in line with their own thinking. The subversion of production
              systems into collective bottom-up logic makes modding a practice
              of activism. This opens up discussions about the role of the user
              within the phone market. If we frame these debates as a public
              discussion, what are the user's rights?

              This paper stems from the need to frame Android modding within a
              broader movement of hacking practices and technological activism.
              Since there are not any books or bibliographic resources
              specifically about Android modding the information I retrieved is
              taken mainly from forum threads, YouTube videos and articles in
              tech magazines. The reconstruction of the birth and development of
              this community is mediated by what has been my approach and
              experience as a user and disseminator. I, therefore, invite people
              to see this text as an attempt at a partial reconstruction of a
              complex movement that includes tens of thousands of developers and
              as many threads on forums and videos.

              According to the Cambridge dictionary, luxury is “something
              expensive that is pleasant to have but is not necessary”.

              >
              Luxury is a driving force because for many people it represents
              one of the keys to positioning themselves in a higher social
              class. In many areas, luxury manifests itself as experiential
              luxury, related to the design of goods. In technology, luxury can
              be seen as an overabundance of computing power and is conveyed
              through data and lists of specs. In this chapter, I intend to
              explore the concept of computational luxury understood as a
              feature that marked the early development of the smartphone
              market. In the decade 2007-2017, we witnessed a technological
              boost that conditioned the social, environmental and technological
              impact of this sector. The phone market was driven by a surplus of
              computing power that monopolized it. Communication has also been
              shaped around selling data, numbers, and the technical features of
              devices, fueling consumerist logic. But in order to grasp this
              logic, we must understand the cultural shift in the software and
              hardware we operate - from advanced office stationery in the 90s
              to a personal accessory of the second half of the 2000s. In the
              late 1990s and early 2000s, mobile devices were seen as business
              tools, which aimed to digitize some office functions (agenda,
              mail, calendar). PDAs (personal digital assistants) were an
              attempt to miniaturize computers, becoming the first mobile
              products to include personal information managing tools. The
              concept of these products is similar to the early computer user
              interfaces, which took full force from the imagery of the office
              to create a digital simile. The metaphor of the desk with files,
              folders, and recycle bin is carried over into the mobile world. It
              takes a business-oriented direction, becoming a status symbol
              among American managers.

              On January 9, 2007, the first step of a big revolution happened:
              Steve Jobs presented the first iPhone at the MacWorld conference
              in San Francisco. With this announcement Apple changed the
              paradigm of these devices forever. Already previously with
              products such as Nokia 9210 Communicator (2001) or the world of
              Pocket PCs there was an attempt to expand this market in this
              direction. However, it’s only after Apple's conference that
              smartphones are consolidated in our daily lives. These objects
              from substitutes for physical office objects (calculator,
              notebook, landline phone) have become our photo and music archives
              as well as leisure and entertainment devices. The way smartphones
              are sold also changed: we moved from a business-oriented type of
              communication to a more intimate and mundane one. Ties and desks
              disappeared from ads and we started to see parents, children,
              living rooms, kitchens and everyday situations. But how to stand
              out in this new technological environment where products become
              more than just the sum of their operations and where the immediate
              utility of technology is obscured?

              In the second decade of the 2000s, smartphone manufacturers spent
              their energies on miniaturizing smartphone components with the
              goal enhancing the performance. From then on, the computational
              luxury sets in. Each year the challenge is to be able to produce a
              device that outperforms both the competitors and their
              predecessors from the previous year. The advertising language is
              enriched with technical terminologies such as PPI, NIT for
              displays; mAh and Watt for battery life and charging speed;
              MegaPixel for cameras and GHz for processors. This approach has
              bent the market to the continuous search for data that can be sold
              to the public, incentivizing the consumerist aspect. This trend
              leads to an obsession with the practice of benchmarking. The goal
              is to stress test the device in order to retrieve a score that can
              be used to compare different phones. While reviews and hands-on
              videos spread across the web, versus.com becomes more and more
              popular. This website allows you to compare the technical
              specifications of different smartphones. Platforms like these
              contribute to shaping the debate in a purely technical realm. We
              can imagine that this tech direction is also a consequence of
              homogenization in terms of design

              through its technical capabilities. Since the variety of shapes,
              screen types, and colors has become obsolete, branding strategies
              had to adapt.

              In this period, manufacturers decided to release more and more
              phones into the market than the usual annual unveilings: hence, an
              overabundance of devices was created. Consumers had to face this
              clutter, being seduced to consider the computational aspect as
              crucial, no longer finding answers in product design. Also
              nomenclatures became more complex: we can notice the widespread
              use of terms like mini, plus, pro and ultra, which confuse the
              consumer. These categories, based on supposedly objective
              technical capabilities rather than aesthetic qualities, created a
              clear hierarchy. Slide-out keyboards, rotating cameras, and satin
              finishes are no longer criteria for producing and categorizing
              phones. The new policy of manufacturers is to produce the flagship
              model with the highest performance possible and saturate the
              market in the mid-range by distributing mini, ultra or max
              variants.<br /><br />After the dramatic spike in phone production
              since 2011, companies have stopped optimizing and updating
              software for the entire product range, focusing only on their
              flagship models. This leads to the abandonment of parallel devices
              of the main models and all those low-mid range phones. The life of
              the products was drastically reduced - if you could not afford a
              flagship phone the device could be considered obsolete at the
              moment of purchase. This new attitude causes an increase in
              planned obsolescence, creating artificial demand generation. To
              prevent abandonware, that is software that ceases to be supported
              by manufacturers, the community of consumers and enthusiasts
              started taking action themselves. According to the International
              Data Corporation Android smartphones held 59% of the market in the
              first quarter of 2012.

              The wide diffusion and the open source nature of Google’s OS
              facilitate hacking practices and flourishing of communities that
              start to develop independent software. It’s in this context of
              smartphones with short life cycles, old or at best poorly
              optimized software that the story of modding begins. This movement
              is a practical response by developers and users to the rush for
              high-end hardware imposed by manufacturers.

              An ecosystem, in biology, describes all the organisms, the
              physical environment in which they live, and defines all of the
              complex interactions and mutual dependencies. The balance that is
              created allows the system to function. For software, the concept
              is much the same
              <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToastNote('note_1_4', 'c1')"

              >
              : services, delivered in the form of applications, interact and
              respond to each other within an environment that provides this
              connection. Within our smartphones we have different services that
              communicate among themselves, optimizing mutually. The
              interconnection is the value that keeps us within a system. We
              choose our preferred ecosystems precisely based on their ability
              to cover not only every area of work but also leisure. We can
              argue that now almost all the systems on our phones are
              ecosystems, and that is true, but on which features do these
              systems change? One aspect we can consider is the openness of the
              system. By openness we can consider how much the environment is
              user-customizable or how prone it is to receive influences from
              third-party components. Openness for a technological ecosystem
              also means how much developers can get their hands on it and have
              access to the mechanics of operation. In the case of Android,
              after certainly being considered one of the systems where the user
              has the most room for action, it also has an open source core:
              this means that much of its code is made available by the parent
              company. But as the tech journalist JR Raphael
              <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToastNote('note_1_5', 'c1')"
                > 5 </sup
              >
              states, the open nature of Android does not only apply to the
              user, who is free to customize his or her device as he or she
              wishes, but it also applies to manufacturers and phone companies,
              which sometimes block the freedom of the system in advance.

              The Android ecosystem is really fragmented and it differs from
              brand to brand, from device to device. Unlike other systems that
              run on a few phones, Android is spread across a large scale of
              devices, and an optimization process is needed. Taking in account
              the most common distribution and use of Android, the system as a
              user perspective can be divided in three layers:<br />
              <br />– The Android Open Source Project (AOSP); <br />– The Google
              Mobile Services (GMS); <br />– The custom interfaces by the
              manufacturers.

              The Android operating system is based mainly on a modified version
              of the Linux Kernel. The core of the system is AOSP (Android Open
              Source Project), a free and open source software released under
              the Apache License. The source code is maintained by Google, which
              updates and releases the code every time a new version of Android
              is released. Even if the core code of the OS is public, the AOSP
              code doesn’t contain the device’s drivers; it’s up to the
              manufacturers to make them available or not. Over the past decade,
              Google has made several decisions that have made Android a system
              increasingly dependent on Google services. Without the Google app
              store for example, you won’t have access to all the apps on the
              market. There are devices, such as educational tablets for kids or
              car tablets, which don’t need to be dependent on Google services.
              They are just using the AOSP code to run a basic version of
              Android. If this can be valid for specific products, for most of
              the smartphones having access to Google Mobile Services is
              fundamental to be part of the Android market. The GMS (Google
              Mobile Services) is composed of a set of apps (like Gmail, Maps,
              Play Store…) and APIs (application programming interfaces) that
              allows the user to have access to all the Google ecosystem on your
              device. This package is usually already installed on most of the
              devices: a report shows how over 70% of smartphones come in the
              market out of the box with the GMS package.

              >
              In order to pre-install the Google services to their devices,
              manufacturers need to buy a license from Google, which is free
              around the world, except for the EU.

              A big problem of Android is the software fragmentation: since the
              system has to run on such a wide range of hardware, delays on
              updates and security patches are common. Google tried to fix the
              problem by updating some of the system apps through the Play
              Store, independently from regular OS updates. In 2012 they
              announced the Play Services, which is a proprietary software
              package that runs in the background, maintaining updated Google
              libraries and services on your phone. These libraries include
              sign-on, location and security protocols, as cloud infrastructures
              for gaming, printing and payment. Play Services was advertised as
              a way for developers to combat fragmentation by helping them
              distribute the code once to every device. Ron Amadeo, a reviewer
              and tech writer specializes in Android OS and Google products,
              wrote on Ars Technica (2013)
              <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToastNote('note_1_8', 'c1')"

              <span style="margin-left: 10%; display: block"
                >Calling Play Services an "app" doesn't really tell the whole
                story. For starters, it has an insane amount of permissions.
                It's basically a system-level process, and if the above list
                isn't enough for whatever it needs to do next, it can actually
                give itself more permissions without the user's consent. Play
                Services constantly runs in the background of every Android
                phone, and nearly every Google app relies on it to function.
                It's updatable, but it doesn't update through the Play Store
                like every other app. It has its own silent, automatic update
                mechanism that the user has no control over. In fact, most of
                the time the user never even knows an update has happened. The
                reason for the complete and absolute power this app has is
                simple: Google Play Services is Google's new platform.</span
              ><br /><br />

              In this way, Google is privatizing several system mechanics,
              making them closed-source. What is left to the Android core if we
              remove most of the functionalities? Can we continue calling it an
              open system? This change caused a lot of issues for modders who
              developed custom ROMs without including Google services: a lot of
              apps that used Play Services (so not only the Google’s ones) could
              no longer run on just AOSP based Android distributions.

              In 2012 FairSearch, a lobbying group of organizations that include
              Microsoft, Oracle and Nokia, sent a complaint to the European
              Commission to expose the monopoly of Google. They state that
              Google forces manufacturers to use its services, orienting Android
              to a more proprietary system. This is not only regarding the
              influence on Android but also the privileged position as a search
              engine. Between 2018 and 2019 Google has been accused of abuse of
              Android dominance by the Competition Commission of India and the
              EU antitrust, leading them to reformulate the services license
              agreement by separating it from the Android OS license. When
              Google understood the big role which the OS could play in the
              smartphone industry, they reverted these changes and closed the
              Android ecosystem. Richard Stallman, free software movement
              activist, has been very critical of this approach, arguing that
              this closed-source drift of Android may totally subvert the
              operating system from its initial purposes.

              The company states that these decisions are made also for security
              reasons but many independent developers, connected to the open
              source communities, claimed that in an environment where code is
              open to access, it’s easier to fix system flaws. The Mountain View
              company is forcing OEMs and developers to buy its license to have
              a complete experience of the OS, slowly turning Android into a

              service. Also, some native applications that at the beginning were
              part of the AOSP, gradually have been substituted into proprietary
              apps. Search, music, messaging, camera, calendar and other
              services have migrated to the Google-branded version. They changed
              their concept of Android: the goal it’s not anymore to build an
              open-source mobile operating system but just provide a structure
              to add Google services.

              emancipate from Android, developing their own linux-based mobile
              OS called Tizen, later abandoned. More manufacturers have begun to

              of business deals with other companies, giving rise to the

              the Google services, used mainly on Fire Tablets but also for the
              Amazon Echo. They created their own launcher, app store, music
              player, browser. Chinese brands such as Huawei, OPPO, Vivo and
              Honor received sanctions from the U.S. government between 2019 and
              2020 for their connection with the Chinese government. In response
              to this, smartphones sold internationally by most of these
              companies are devoid of the GMS package and the Android trademark,
              as they are no longer supported by Google.

              <br /><br />Independent developers have tried to develop their own
              ecosystems and take advantage only of Android's open source core.
              In communities connected to open source and free software ideals,
              it’s common to find product and software subversion practices.
              These solutions are part of what Cory Doctorow calls "Adversarial
              Interoperability".

              This phenomenon involves creating a product or service that fits
              into existing products without the company's permission. It’s a
              way for users to regain agency over their devices. The first one
              was CyanogenMod, one of the most popular
              <a
                class="hand_glossary"

              ever, which later developed its CM Apps as opposed to Google Apps.
              The CyanogenMod successor, LineageOS, included a free and open
              source implementation of Google libraries called microG. This
              project, mainly maintained by Marvin Wißfeld, has the goal to
              replicate the main APIs provided by Play Services avoiding
              installing the official components and without collecting data
              from the user activity. microG, together with some aftermarket app
              stores like Aptoide or F-droid (which contains only free and
              open-source apps) become really popular in the modding environment
              for connecting official and unofficial ecosystems. The Murena
              company and /e/ foundation (who is the main supporter of microG)
              resell refurbished smartphones with their /e/OS on board, which
              aims to prevent Google from collecting data.

              They replaced Google Apps with services that provide a better
              level of privacy and anti-tracking policy.

              Tracing the history of modding is in some way reconstructing the
              Android evolution through the years. The practice of modding
              started together with the first Android phone: The HTC Dream G1.
              In September 2008, a method of obtaining administrator privileges,

              be installed. A small group of independent developers have been
              getting involved by creating unofficial builds, not released by
              the companies, called
              <a

                >custom ROMs</a
              >. The first popular custom ROM was developed in November 2008,
              just two months after the distribution of the phone, and it’s
              called JF ROM, from the main developer JesusFreke.

              and he recommended to his fanbase to install a new ROM from a
              developer called Cyanogen. Behind Cyanogen there is Stefanie
              Kondik, a Samsung software engineer who is the creator of the most
              popular Android ROM ever: the CyanogenMod. The CyanogenMod was the
              most influential distribution for several reasons: both in
              popularity but also in the vision it carried. As we will later see
              in the custom ROM section of this chapter, the key-word in those
              firmwares is customization. Not only does it involve applying
              aesthetic changes, as a custom skin would, but it also allows you
              to tweak battery settings, the processor's

              system settings as well. The widespread popularity in the forums
              accelerated the process of institutionalization of this project as
              the main alternative to the stock software in the Android market.
              They were the first to introduce the

              (over the air) update system, typical of proprietary software, to
              an independent project, simplifying the firmware update process
              and making modding a more mainstream practice.<br /><br />Another
              famous name in the first modding era was AOKP (Android Open Kang
              Project), released starting from 2011. The name is a portmanteau
              of “kang”, intended as stolen code, and “AOSP”. The main features
              of this ROM were also oriented to the customization as the
              CyanogenMod, with a special submenu dedicated to edit different
              aspects of the interface such as the status bar, the navigation
              bar, the lockscreen, the home screen and much more. This phase of
              the modding was focused on investigating the potential of the
              software by exploring its more technical aspects. Testing the
              limits of the working environment allows us to set the boundaries
              between what is possible and how far we are from implementing
              certain concepts in the interface.

              Since 2012, Android modding communities have been spreading. It is
              during this year that some of the most popular ROMs such as
              OmniROM, Resurrection Remix OS, SlimRoms and Paranoid Android are
              developed. In September 2013, the developer Rohan Mathur, a member
              of the Team Kang developer group, said in a tweet
              <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToastNote('note_2_3', 'c2')"
                > 3 </sup

              that their AOKP ROM had reached 3.5 million users: modding had
              become a settled trend in Android devices. Two strands of ROMs
              emerge at this stage of modding: the first, on the path of early
              concepts, tends to favor strong customization, including many
              features from different manufacturers. The second, including
              Paranoid Android or Slimroms, aims to offer the purest and
              minimalistic Android experience, focusing on bringing the most
              up-to-date system versions to as many devices as possible. A key
              event happened in 2013: Cyanogen Inc. was founded with an initial
              investment of $7 million, with the goal of commercializing the
              CyanogenMod project. This opening to the market was frowned upon
              by the modders communities that populate the forums. Many
              developers complained seeing their efforts capitalized, even
              without having received proper recognition or compensation for
              their free work.

              As modding began to take hold, the established business of Android
              got interested in this underground world. The big response from
              the users pushed even Google in 2014 to try to acquire, without
              any success, the CyanogenMod.

              the interruption of the support of the ROM, keeping all the source
              code available for those interested. The project that has
              inherited the lead role among ROMs is LineageOS. Originating from
              the CyanogenMod team, it is still the most highly distributed
              today so much so that many of the custom ROMs draw from its source
              code. However, the Cyanogen case was not the only instance of the
              mainstream market's foray into the modding undergrowth. It’s not
              rare that developers from the forums community were hired by
              companies to bring the experience they had in the independent
              world to the established market. Hung-Lin "John" Wu (known as
              topjohnwu on many forums), the creator of the famous rooting tool
              Magisk, was hired by Google in May 2021.

              Many of the Android developers come from the world of Linux and
              free software. Since the 1990s, these groups have had a strong
              influence on the imagery and philosophy behind the outputs they
              produced. A strong imprint was made by the hacker movement, which
              sees information sharing as a duty. A core value is freedom of
              information understood as the freedom to publish and access
              information. Open knowledge movements promote both open content
              practices, such as open source software, publication of open data,
              and open research methodologies.

              The hacker ethic promotes several principles that we can find in
              Android modding. The promotion of decentralization occurs in this
              movement through the adoption of distributed systems for software
              development and a general rejection of bureaucracy. They build
              their collective knowledge in forum threads and repositories, in
              which everyone is welcome to contribute. We can claim that the
              vision of software development understood as a sort of artistic
              practice (as hackers believe) is also an aspect found in modding.
              Many of the efforts are focused on changes that could be defined
              as not purely functional, such as themes and
              <a

                >skins</a
              >, that cover a more personal and artistic needs. The anti
              discriminatory matrix of hackers, for whom age, gender, race, or
              education are not elements of judgment, is often preserved by the
              anonymous nature of users in forums, who use nicknames and avatars
              to represent themselves. Their common vision is simply to improve
              their experience as users, in line with the hacker principle that
              computers are tools that should be used to improve our lives.

              According to Steven Levy, if as many people in society would take
              this pose, computers would bring an improvement to our world.
              Other similarities can be seen in the Right to Repair movements.

              A common battle being fought on by the two movements is over

              This is seen as a consumer right. For these activists, it’s
              important to give users/consumers the tools to understand their
              devices, through manuals and guides. The dissemination of
              information and manuals plays a key role in Android modding: the
              majority of writings in forums consists of tutorials and
              installation guides. In this context, developers also acquire
              activist characteristics as they advocate for a more free, open
              and decentralized technology. This demonstrates the political
              aspect of modding. Their practice goes beyond software development
              but is an expression of an idea of technology that they intend to
              apply to society. When tech-enthusiasts enter into those
              communities they start to act as citizens. The users seek to
              counter balance market trends imposed by manufacturers by creating
              their own patch and structures:
              <a
                class="hand_glossary"
                onmouseover="openToastGlossaryOver('glossary_mod', 'c2')"
                onmouseleave="closeToastGlossaryOver()"

                >mods</a
              >. This hacking practice counteracts planned obsolescence and
              reverses the production relationship from top-down to bottom- up.
              If we consider computational luxury, as well as any luxury, a
              symbol of belonging to an elevated social class, then modding is a
              political practice. Modding tries to break down social differences
              by redistributing software resources equally to different product
              ranges. Mods, skins, themes and custom ROMs are the user's
              response to computational luxury. Modders are transforming the
              debate around a private market into something public. In doing so
              they bring to light some questions. How can users/citizens have
              agency over the smartphone industry? Are tech companies part of
              the public sphere? If so, what are the users’ rights?

              There is something they inherit from these movements but they make
              it more personal, which is the attitude. It can be described with
              the term "explorative playfulness". Explorative in the way that
              they make use of experiments, sometimes even incomplete or fully
              functioning, to investigate the interface. This characteristic
              leads them to create mods and ROMs to understand their
              surroundings. The practice of modding is thus an exploration
              through which they test the software boundaries on which they
              operate. Playful since the motivating drive to produce software is
              primarily passion and curiosity about firmware. There is no
              substantial financial return except in the form of donations or
              special cases of partnerships. Play also comes from the free
              choice to work on very specific aspects, making them identitary:
              changing an icon, a color to an element or adding a feature
              becomes a source of pride for some users. There is usually a
              sincere enthusiasm to share the progress with the rest of the
              community. For example, we have seen that early custom ROMs such
              as JF ROM or CyanogenMod owe their names to the nicknames of their
              creators. It’s a way to gain credibility in a network where
              peer-to-peer reputation is one of the few returns on his or her
              own contribution. This collective activity also leads modders to
              impart conceptual value, sometimes even unconsciously, to a
              primarily technical action. Hence, the driving force behind this
              practice is the desire to experiment with a set of tools combined
              with a playful enthusiasm. The hacker in the common imagination is
              a saboteur who tries to steal data and destroy infrastructure, but
              it’s not like that. The figure just described is what is called a

              The practice of modding includes several procedures that allow you
              to have more control over your device. As we will see, some of
              these are hindered by manufacturers and involve limitations in the
              use and maintenance of the smartphone. Since all

              develop their products differently from the others, it's not
              possible to draw a standard procedure for modding each device.
              It's true, however, that the basic principles remain the same, and
              here we will try to trace them. They can be summarized as:<br />
              <br />– obtaining administrator privileges (root access); <br />–
              installing apps or frameworks that require root; <br />– unlocking
              the bootloader; <br />– installing a custom recovery; <br />–
              flashing mods; <br />– flashing custom ROMs.

              One of the first procedures you can perform is to obtain root
              permissions. As regular users we only have access to part of the
              files on our phone. To access and/or modify system files, we need
              special permissions. Obtaining root permissions therefore means
              that we can more deeply modify components of the device.
              Applications that allow deep backups, change firmware functions
              and design may require these permissions to function properly. At
              times some applications that require certain security standards
              may not work once root access is obtained, as well as system
              updates may be blocked. To begin the deeper modding process, a
              required step is to unlock the bootloader. The bootloader is a
              software that runs every time you turn on your device. Usually it
              can start the Android OS, boot into recovery or other modes. The
              bootloader also verifies the integrity of the boot and recovery
              partitions before executing the
              <a
                class="hand_glossary"
                onmouseover="openToastGlossaryOver('glossary_kernel', 'c2')"

                >kernel</a
              >. Having an unlocked bootloader allows you to install unofficial
              firmwares and recoveries. Unlocking the bootloader can be
              accomplished by using certain tools that are different for each
              brand. For some manufacturers, once the bootloader is unlocked,
              the device's warranty is voided, but it’s not always like this. In
              some cases it’s the manufacturers themselves who make the
              procedure available on their websites, like it happens for HTC and
              Sony or, rarely, the device is already unlocked at the moment of
              purchase.

              Next, our device is ready to replace the system recovery with a
              third-party one. A recovery it's a bootable partition on your
              smartphone that can restore your phone to the conditions of
              purchase, wipe some partitions and install new updates. To access
              the recovery you need to press a combination of keys while the
              device is turning on. After-market Android recovery solutions
              provide the ability to create a backup of an Android device and
              data on external storage, and the most important aspect, install
              unofficial software like mods or custom ROMs.

              Now that we have all the requirements, we can search the sections
              of the forums dedicated to our phone model and look for mods to
              install. Typically mods come as a .zip package to be flashed via
              recovery, but procedures may vary. Each discussion in which a mod
              is posted is usually accompanied by an installation guide. It's
              not easy to give an idea of the potential of mods, as it's
              possible to change practically every aspect of the device. I will
              therefore take the Samsung Galaxy SII as an example, since it's a
              model that has received much attention from the modders'
              community, to illustrate some examples of mods.

              The variety of mods reflects users' intentions: for some, modding
              is a solution to fix problems that the manufacturer does not care
              about. For others a way to enhance their device with new features,
              and in this sense it fully represents Cory Doctorow's adversarial
              interoperability. For some, modding is more of a playful thing: a
              series of experiments, even on graphical minutiae, arising from
              the enthusiasm of the infinite possibilities. In addition, in the
              forums you can also find alternative

              that you can install again using the same procedure as a mod. But
              it’s not only by flashing mods that you can change your device.
              Since 2013 some toolkits have become popular among tech-enthusiast
              like Xposed Framework and Magisk. These are platforms that allow
              you to install third-party mods to customize your phone without
              using the recovery. Both systems need root permissions to work.
              One of the most famous mod for Xposed Framework is GravityBox,
              which allows for customization of the status bar, navigation bar,
              lockscreen, notification system, and more. GravityBox was also
              defined as a ROM-killer module, since it brings most of the visual
              customization available through custom firmware with a simple app.
              Magisk is a suite of tools created by developer John Wu that
              includes not only a module manager but also an app for managing
              <a

                >root permissions</a
              >. Just as with Xposed, Magisk modules range from changing system
              fonts, customizing gestures and commands, or calibrating CPU
              power. Over time, mods that bring features or aesthetic
              improvements have been incorporated into toolkits such as those
              just described or integrated within custom ROMs.

              Now let's take a look at the main core of the Android Modding: the
              custom ROMs. There are a wide variety of ROMs out there, here we
              are going to analyze some of the most popular ones, trying to
              understand how they differ and what main innovations they have
              brought to the Android interface. At a conceptual level, we can
              recognize different categories of ROM, which have different
              goals:<br />
              <br />– those that try to be more full featured, including as many
              customizations as possible (such as AOKP or ResurrectionRemix);
              <br />– those that aim to maintain an environment more similar to
              pure Android, focusing on few features that distinguish them (such
              as Paranoid Android and SlimRom); <br />– the hybrid ones, which
              try to find a balance between the two trends (such as CyanogenMod,
              OmniROM or LineageOS).<br /><br />
              This variety reflects the needs of different users. Some users
              want to modify and get their hands on every color, icon, gesture,
              function, making the system sometimes even less performant but
              more personal. They perceive their device as an object to be
              analyzed and disassembled, and the ROM becomes their toolbox.
              Other users simply seek an efficient and up-to-date system,
              perhaps even with features that the manufacturer of their model
              has not implemented, but more performance-oriented.<br /><br />Comparing
              the most popular early ROMs, CyanogenMod and AOKP, we can see
              their totally different vision. CyanogenMod initially emerged as
              the main custom ROMs, focusing on diffusion: in 2016 it was
              compatible with more than 570 devices.
              <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToastNote('note_2_11', 'c2')"
                > 11 </sup
              >
              AOKP, however, available still on major smartphone models, made
              customization its strong point. It was the first to include a
              specific option in the settings dedicated to custom changes,
              called ROM Control. From here it's possible to change not only the
              appearance of the status bar, navigation bar, notification panel,
              and lockscreen (as is also the case with CyanogenMod) but much
              more: from the type of vibration, to the boot animation, through
              the use of a tablet mode. Some noteworthy features are ribbons,
              which are swipe-activated menus in which to enter shortcuts to
              apps or functions. In addition, the AOKP team was the first to
              include in 2013 the ability to adopt dark mode and a section to
              manage individual app permissions (features that Google did not
              include in stock Android until 2019).

              The main virtue of CyanogenMod is stability: the huge community
              behind it has ensured a good level of performance, making sure to
              bring a fully functioning firmware, which is rare for custom
              releases. Over the years it has introduced and later removed
              multiple features, incorporating the peculiarities of other
              related projects. It certainly brought innovations to the modding
              scene, such as the

              firmware that allowed users to open a proprietary account to

              the project.

              Another ROM worth mentioning is Paranoid Android: an example of
              very slim firmware similar to stock Android. This project
              originated under the name AOSPA, which recalls the pure and open
              source nature of Android. Although over the years it has never
              fallen for the allure of massive customization of coeval firmware,
              it's known for introducing some innovations. Most obvious of all
              is the pie control, which is a radial dial of shortcuts accessible
              with a swipe, replacing the navigation bar. Connected to this is
              the immersive mode, which hides the navigation and status bars on
              the short sides of the display to take full advantage of it. With
              the pie control the Paranoid Android team sensed a trend that was
              soon to explode: maximum optimization of screen area. First with
              virtual buttons and gestures

              >
              to save lower space and then with the notch for the upper one, the
              market followed this process of simplification with physical and
              digital design solutions.

              The history of ROMs, unlike mods and other expressions of modding,
              entails a broader story of Android hacking. Since they are more
              structured projects we can grasp the ideals of developers and
              users. We can understand why certain firmware has had more
              traction than others and what really moves thousands of developers
              to produce free software for the benefit of the community. The
              explorative playfulness plus a political push kept Android a free
              environment, in a decade in which big players and manufacturers

              A key aspect for any community are the spaces of gathering: a
              community is such when it establishes its own spaces, rituals and
              keeps track of their cultural production. These spaces are home to
              the collective knowledge constructed by members and they tell
              something about the methodologies they adopt. Since modding
              includes an international community, the spaces are therefore
              online platforms. To address the different ways in which this
              community produces knowledge, we will divide the discussion into
              two sets of tools: the ones used for internal communication and
              those for reaching an external audience. For the first category
              these spaces are mainly repositories and specialized forums. Those
              tools are structured in a decentralized way. Repositories are web
              platforms, which tend to be distributed systems, where developers
              keep track of software, with a shared versioning system. Many of
              the developers use GitHub as a working environment for ROMs and
              mods, similar to other projects with an open source nature. The
              user jbro129, starting in 2021, has collected the most popular
              repositories regarding Android modding within one page
              <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToastNote('note_2_13', 'c2')"
                > 13 </sup
              >, ranging from mod and themes, to toolkits and tutorials. It’s
              not uncommon, for more structured projects, to have their own
              platform to host the development. The LineageOS team has built a
              framework based on Gerrit, a web-based team code collaboration
              tool.

              Specialist forums provide both a channel for software publication
              and a space for peer-to-peer dialogue. It’s here that slang,
              trends, schools of thought and new projects are born. The most
              famous forum for Android modding is XDA developers. Founded in
              2003 as a hub for Windows Mobile enthusiasts

              enthusiasts in the early 2010s. This forum has a section for
              almost every smartphone on the market: for each section users
              create threads filtered by different categories like apps and
              themes, Android development, or more general chat section.

              To share their knowledge with an external audience, modders use
              mainly two tools: the forum threads and YouTube videos. Forums,
              given also the more extensive structure, remain the main choice
              for posting projects and providing technical support. If forums
              are familiar environments for open source development communities,
              YouTube videos are something unheard of in these pioneering years.
              YouTube had a boost in popularity around 2011-2012, together with
              modding communities, so it became an important space for
              dissemination. The forum threads are mostly animated by
              experienced users, or at least those who have a basic knowledge of
              the topic: this presents a stumbling block for a novice user who
              is immediately confronted with complicated technical language.
              Video tutorials may be easier to understand, either because of the
              ability to follow on-screen steps, or because the content is
              sometimes re-edited to be more digestible. YouTube tutorials are
              the bridge between technical knowledge of developers and the needs
              or curiosities of a more general audience.<br /><br />On YouTube
              there are three different types of tutorials. The most common is a
              visual step-by-step demonstration, featuring a person who shows
              how to achieve a result guiding the audience through all the
              steps. The second category is the walk-through, in which a person
              performs a replica of a process to demonstrate it in front of an
              audience. For modders, the breakdown of processes consists of
              video guides on how to install pieces of software. Then the third
              kind is more similar to a lecture format and consists of a talk
              about a subject, helped by visual materials. The tutorial is a
              medium that embodies the features of informal learning.
              <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToastNote('note_2_15', 'c2')"
                > 15 </sup
              >
              One characteristic is the interactive feedback mechanism, meaning
              that part of the knowledge also resides in the exchange that is
              made in the comments section of each video. This can be also seen
              as an example of another of the qualities of video tutorials: they
              use a mix of different learning techniques to communicate content.
              In music we talk about "pedagogical syncretism" when learning from
              different sources, similarly with modding tutorials. They mix
              textual, verbal, and visual explanations. Footage, screen
              recordings as well as diagrams contribute to the explanation.

              Ultimately, a phenomenon that needs to be taken into account is
              incidental learning. As Lange (2018), an associate professor of
              critical studies at California College of the Arts, states:<br /><br />

              <span style="margin-left: 10%; display: block"
                >As a subset of informal learning—incidental learning—may prompt
                learners to reevaluate tacit assumptions, recognize mistakes,
                and reconsider their interpretations of others’ actions.
                Ideally, for incidental learning to take root, it must
                eventually move from being tacit to a state of recognized
                awareness, through processes of self-reflection.

              Then, during the process of watching a video tutorial, we not only
              learn the content, but also tend to critically absorb how it is
              conveyed. This in the modding community becomes very productive:
              users are often creators and users at the same time. Thinking
              about how to effectively explain a procedure helps peer
              communication. All these peculiarities have made YouTube an
              outreach platform that has contributed to the fortunes of modding.

              Since 2020 the development of the hardware is slowing down since
              we reached a saturation of some features like the display density
              or the amount of RAM. The politics of computational luxury can no
              longer be perpetrated by manufacturers. Concerning the software,
              modding is not as popular as before because most of the brands try
              to keep their system closed blocking self customization practices.

              are trying to regain control over the market by making decisions
              in the software sector. For example in 2021 Samsung made the
              camera inefficient in the Galaxy Z Fold3 for the users who
              unlocked the bootloader.

              >
              On the other hand there are still a lot of Android users who use
              custom ROMs and mods. The Samsung Galaxy S III and Note II are
              still updated after ten years after being introduced.
              <sup class="hand_note" onclick="openToastNote('note_3_2', 'c3')"

              >
              Modding survives still today for several reasons: one of them is
              to keep the software in older models updated, with the goal of
              counteracting the short life of the devices. Moreover, there are
              several fork experiments that aim to improve OS security and
              privacy, such as CalyxOS, CopperheadOS, and GrapheneOS (all three
              born in 2022). Many users install modules or custom ROMs to
              customize their devices and adapt them to their own needs more
              than manufacturers do for them. In this sense, the practice of
              explorative playfulness still lives on forcefully. The market
              based on computational luxury has generated a great lack on the
              software side. The increase in computing power has made it less
              necessary to optimize apps. The hardware race competed by
              different manufacturers has left much room for modding to provide
              software support. Android's biggest problem remains fragmentation
              and scarce software optimization. The Play Store is full of apps
              that are similar to each other and poorly developed. The ability
              to install third-party apps from the store, which was one of the
              key aspects of smartphones, faded into the background in this
              first smartphone era. Consumers today rely on one brand over
              another for the suite of apps and features that manufacturers
              offer. In this sense, we are almost back to the pre-smartphone
              era. The large assortment of possibilities that these systems
              preached has been reduced to the fifty most popular third-party
              apps.

              With the design project, I intend to analyze the modding movement
              from both theoretical and practical perspectives. This website
              hosts the research content and a collection of workshop results.
              The intent is to create a platform that can be updated over time.
              In addition to the research, published as an essay, the website
              contains videos that unpack theoretical/philosophical aspects of
              modding. The videos are vlogs/video essays that, with a referral
              to YouTube's tutorial culture, hybridize an informative section to
              a more reflective one. The videos are an entry point, a bridge
              between the modding theoretical framework contained in the
              research and a physical activity. The language is characterized by
              a mix of techniques ranging from direct shooting, device screen
              recording, and the use of diagrams which are commented on by the
              host. They are introductory lectures to the workshop. The object
              of investigation of the workshop is the interface, which is the
              medium that contains all the contradictions between the closed,
              market-driven software and the open, experimental, and independent
              one. The workshop takes into account a collective brainstorming
              phase to focus on users' ideals and needs. The purpose of this
              first phase is to create a sharing space in which to introduce
              theoretical reflection into a purely technical domain. With an
              approach of explorative playfulness, not unlike the modders, we
              will try to translate participants' concepts into features to be
              implemented in the interface. At the same time, it is a discussion
              about the practice of modding as a collective activity. Starting
              with technical problem solving, it creates new imagery, though
              interfaces, that makes users more aware of their tools.
